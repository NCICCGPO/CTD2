Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype associated with 
early metastatic recurrence and worse patient outcomes. TNBC tumors express 
molecular markers of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), but its 
requirement during spontaneous TNBC metastasis in vivo remains incompletely 
understood. We demonstrated that spontaneous TNBC tumors from a genetically 
engineered mouse model (GEMM), multiple patient-derived xenografts, and archival 
patient samples exhibited large populations in vivo of hybrid E/M cells that 
lead invasion ex vivo while expressing both epithelial and mesenchymal 
characteristics. The mesenchymal marker vimentin promoted invasion and repressed 
metastatic outgrowth. We next tested the requirement for five EMT transcription 
factors and observed distinct patterns of utilization during invasion and colony 
formation. These differences suggested a sequential activation of multiple EMT 
molecular programs during the metastatic cascade. Consistent with this model, 
our longitudinal single-cell RNA analysis detected three different EMT-related 
molecular patterns. We observed cancer cells progressing from epithelial to 
hybrid E/M and strongly mesenchymal patterns during invasion and from epithelial 
to a hybrid E/M pattern during colony formation. We next investigated the 
relative epithelial versus mesenchymal state of cancer cells in both GEMM and 
patient metastases. In both contexts, we observed heterogeneity between and 
within metastases in the same individual. We observed a complex spectrum of 
epithelial, hybrid E/M, and mesenchymal cell states within metastases, 
suggesting that there are multiple successful molecular strategies for distant 
organ colonization. Together, our results demonstrate an important and complex 
role for EMT programs during TNBC metastasis.
