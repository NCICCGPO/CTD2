# CTD2-Network Software Repository

This repository contains software created by Cancer Target Discovery and Development (CTD2) Centers, <https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/ctd2>.

The repository is organized with top-level directories corresponding to individual CTD2 centers, and within each Center-level directory sub-directories for each software project.

# Licensing

The Unlicense, available from <https://unlicense.org>, is the default license for software in this repository. If a subdirectory contains a license file (a file whose name, converted to uppercase, matches LICENSE, and which may have any extension or no extension), that license applies to that directory and all subdirectories, unless superseded by a subsequence license file deeper in the path.
